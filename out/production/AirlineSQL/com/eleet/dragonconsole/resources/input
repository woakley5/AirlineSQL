&00&c--- &X-Dragon&x-Console &00Input Script &c---&00

One of the new features of &X-Dragon&x-Console &003.0 is Input Script, the first in a
series of scriptable text segments that will give the programmer more control
over how text is displayed and handled in the console.

&R-- What does Input Script Do?&00

Input Script only works when you are using "&C-Inline Input&00" (which is on by
default) and it allows you to specify where in your output you want input to
start and end and how it should be displayed. There are four ways to set up
input:

&G-Un-Protected Infinite &00- The user can type from the last line of output until
they choose to stop, pressing enter will cause the Console to read the input and
send it to it's registered CommandProcessor if one has been registered.

&G-Protected Infinite &00- Functions the same as Un-Protected Infinite however all
text is displayed on screen as "&C-*&00" (by default, this can be changed by calling
the &R-setProtectedCharacter(&l-char&R-)&00 of the &X-Dragon&x-Console class).

&G-Un-Protected Ranged &00- Ranged Input is input that has a set number of characters.
Ranged Input is also the only input that have more output after the "&C-input area&00"
as Infinite Input ignores anything after the Input Script. Ranged Input can be
useful when designing menu systems.

&G-Protected Ranged &00- Functions the same as Ranged input, however any input from
the user is output as the protected character which is, by default, a "&C-*&00".

&R-- What does Input Script Look Like?&00

Now you know what Input Script does, but what does it look like? Input Script is
formatted as follows

  &C-%%i#+;&00

Let's break that down and explain each part. The "&C-%%&00" is the &X-Dragon&x-Console
Script character that notifies the console that Script will follow. The "&C-i&00"
tells the console that this is Input Script, the "&C-#&00" is a valid &l-integer&00 that
specifies the maximum range of the input, if the input is Infinite (has no max
range) then you can omit the number. The final character "&C-+&00" tells the console
if this input is protected or not. The "&C-+&00" tells the console to protect this
input, a "&C--&00" tells the console not to protect this input, or you can omit this
character and the console assumes the input should not be protected.

I hope that helped you better understand Input Script.&00
