&X-Dragon&00Console &00supports color output, and to create the rich output is extremely
simple! When you &R-append &00a String to the console it will process the String for
any color codes and add the String to the document with the proper styles for
each section.

Let's color a prompt! We'll use &C-"&00prompt@example> &C-" &00and without color you see:

&00prompt@example>

&00Which can be kind of boring, but with color we can change that. We'll use the
new prompt with color codes &C-"&00&&rbprompt&&lb@&&Gbexample&&cb> &C-" &00to get:

&r-prompt&l-@&G-example&C->

&00Which is now much easier to denote each separate portion and it pops off the
screen. Are the colors required, of course not, but they make everything look
better if used appropriately.

So, how exactly do you create a proper color code? Well lets see, a color code
consists of a color code character, a foreground character, and background
character.

  &C-&&FB

&00The "&C-&&&00" is the default color code character (can be changed with
&R-setColorCodeChar(&l-char&R-)&00) the "&C-F&00" is the Foreground color character
and the "&C-B&00" is the Background color character. By default there are a
number of colors added to the console and you can add anymore that you want
with &R-addTextColor(&l-char&R-, &l-Color&R-)&00.

Colors that are built in:

Purple              p           &p-Purple&00
Dark Purple         P           &P-Dark Purple&00

Colors can also have a specific background like if you wanted to &byhighlight
&00something important.

In addition to the Built in Color Codes there are two characters that can be
used that do not have a color attached to them and they are "&C-0&00" and "&C--&00".
The "&C-0&00" is used as "&C-&&00&00" which will reset the current style to the
default value. The "&C--&00" is used in place of a color, and it means "&C-carry
over the previous value&00" for whichever spot you leave it. Given that the Color
Code format is "&C-&&FB&00" the code "&C-&&-B&00" translates to "&C-use the previous
foreground color with this new background color&00" and the code "&C-&&F-&00" translates
to "&C-use this new foreground on the previous background color&00."

That's a brief explanation of color codes and colors.&00
